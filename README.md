# PineRidgeEnergyProject
Project for preliminary design and analysis of a sustainable energy system for Pine Ridge reservation - part of project for class SET3815-Pr (Systems Integration Project)

The primary tasks of the project were:
- Simulation of electrical system load for various scenarios
- Identification  and sizing of an energy system consisting of a primary renewable energy source, secondary renewable source, and battery system
- Design of a simple control system governing the set points of all components in order to meet demand in real time with minimal interaction with the external grid.

Design is preliminary, and in several aspects differs markedly from realistic design assumptions in order to meet course desiderata.
